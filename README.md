# Project Description
This project involves developing and deploying a credit scoring model to assess the creditworthiness of loan applicants. It encompasses building a machine learning model, deploying it as a microservice on AWS, and implementing monitoring and alerting mechanisms to ensure system reliability and performance.

# Running the Application
To run the application, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository:

sh 

Copy code

git clone <repository_url>

- Install the required packages:

sh

Copy code

pip install -r requirements.txt

- Create and activate a virtual environment:

sh

Copy code

pip install virtualenv

python -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate --# On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

- Docker Pull Command
To pull the latest version of the credit scoring simulator image from Docker Hub, use:

sh

Copy code

docker pull deepakshandilya/

credit-scoring-simulator:latest

# Project Components
- a) Credit Scoring Model Development:

Collect and preprocess historical loan data (applicant info, credit history, income, loan performance).
Train a machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression, random forest) to predict default likelihood.

- b) Model Deployment as a Microservice:

Containerize the trained model using Docker.
Deploy and manage the model microservice on AWS using Kubernetes (EKS).

- c) API Gateway and Service Mesh Integration

Use AWS API Gateway to expose the model as a RESTful API.
Implement Istio for microservice communication management and security.

- d) Monitoring and Alerting

Use AWS CloudWatch and Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring.

Track metrics such as model performance, latency, and resource utilization.

- e) Data Privacy and Compliance
Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

Implement data access controls and encryption mechanisms.

Monitor and audit data access for regulatory compliance.

# Project Goals

Develop and deploy a high-availability credit scoring model as a microservice on AWS.

Implement real-time monitoring and alerting for performance and anomaly detection.

Ensure compliance with data privacy and regulatory requirements.

# Additional Considerations

Evaluate model performance with real-world data and validate accuracy.

Implement A/B testing for different model versions.

Document architecture, deployment, and monitoring configurations.
